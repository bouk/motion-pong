This is the source code for a school project done by Bouke van der Bijl and Yannick Middelkoop

It is an implementation of pong which uses the webcam to control the paddles

## Requirements to run

* [PyBox2d](http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/)
* [OpenCV (compiled with some GIL locks removed)](https://github.com/boukevanderbijl/opencv)
* [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html)
* Python 2.7
* 2 green circles like these:

Just stand in front of your webcam and (with sufficient lighting) the game should detect the green circles and move the in-game paddles to their correct positions.
